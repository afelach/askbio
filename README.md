# Perl DNA Sequence Manipulation

This project contains a simple Perl script that performs basic operations on a DNA sequence.

## Description

The script performs the following operations:

- Declares a DNA sequence: `ATGCTAGC`
- Finds and prints the length of the sequence
- Converts the sequence to lowercase and prints it
- Reverses the sequence and prints it

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
perl dna_sequence.pl
